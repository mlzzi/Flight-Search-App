# Flight Search App

This project is based on the Google Developers Codelab: **Create a Flight Search app**. It helps you build an Android app that allows users to search for flights departing from a specific airport, save favorite flights, and update the database with Room.

## About this project

- **Search functionality**: Users can input a departure airport, and the app will search a pre-populated database to display flights departing from that airport.
- **Favorites**: Users can save their favorite flights for easy access.
- **Database updates**: Flight data is stored in a local database and can be updated using Room.
- **Data storage**: The app uses DataStore to store simple data like user preferences.
